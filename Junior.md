Name some built in types: bool, byte, sbyte, char, decimal, double, float int

What is a static type: Something that is about at the class level instead of instance level

What is a namespace: A logical container to group similar code. Namespaces help to avoid naming conflicts between classes and files

What are some differences between a value and reference type: Value types go on the stack, reference on the heap. Value types use value based comparison of attribute, reference types are compared by pointer reference. Value types are passed by copy, reference types by pointer. Value types live and die in scope, reference types live and die via their references
